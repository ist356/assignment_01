# IST356 Assignment 01 (assignment_01)

## Meta

### Learning Objectives

This assignment is more about how to complete an assignment in this course than it is about Python programming. By the end of this assignment, you will know how to:

1. run and debug code in the VS Code editor
2. run python tests to verify your code is correct using pytest and the VS Code activity bar
3. install assignment dependencies using `requirements.txt`
4. edit your reflection, requred as part of your assignment submission
5. submit your assignment using git
TODO ???

### Assignment Layout

The each assignment will have a common layout.

- `code` folder contains our code / application. This is where you will create files and write code.
- `code/solution` folder contains the solution to the assignment, for reference.
- `tests` folder contains code to test our application
- `requirements.txt` contains the packages we need to `pip install` to execute the application code
- `readme.md` contains these instructions
- `.vscode` folder contains VS Code setup configurations for running / debugging the application and tests.
-  `reflection.md` is where you submit your reflection, comments on what you learned, things that confuse you, etc.

### Prerequisites 

Before starting this assignment you must:

Install the assignemnt python requirements:

1. From VS Code, open a terminal: Menu => Terminal => New Terminal
2. In the terminal, type and enter: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


### Running Tests

There is some code and tests already working in this assignment. These are sanity checks to ensure VS Code is configured properly.

1. Open **Testing** in the activity bar: Menu => View => Testing
2. Open the **>** by clicking on it next to **assignment_01**. Keep clicking on **>** until you see **test_sould_pass** in the **test_assignment.py**
3. Click the Play button `|>` next to **test_should_pass** to execute the test. 
4. A green check means the test code ran and the test has passed.
5. A red X means the test code ran but the test has failed. When a test fails you will be given an error message and stack trace with line numbers.

## Assignment

Debug Exercise
- Use the tests to verify the code does not pass.
- use the debugger to trace the code.
- fix the code
- check to see if tests pass

Code independently
- something with a list and a dictionary
